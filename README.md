## Project Overview
The WiDS Datathon 2025 Global Challenge on Kaggle is a predictive modeling challenge focused on analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) to forecast patient risk levels in hospitals. While the Break Through Tech AI Program (BTTAI) isn’t directly linked to this specific competition, initiatives like BTTAI  encourage participation in such events to provide students with hands-on AI/data science experience. Competitions like this align with Break Through Tech’s mission to bridge classroom learning with real-world applications, fostering skills in machine learning and healthcare analytics.

The challenge aims to build a model that accurately predicts patient risk using EHR data, enabling proactive care and resource optimization. This work has critical real-world significance: it could improve patient outcomes by identifying high-risk individuals early, streamline healthcare resource allocation, and reduce costs by preventing complications. Successful models could enhance clinical decision-making, promote early intervention for chronic diseases, and contribute to more efficient, equitable healthcare systems. By tackling this problem, we are helping to directly address gaps in healthcare analytics, offering actionable insights that could save lives and improve global health infrastructure.

## Data Exploration

The WiDS Datathon uses real-world datasets tailored to each year’s challenge. The 2025 Global Challenge uses the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset, which includes functional connectivity matrices (processed via RBC pipelines), P-factor/bifactor analysis, and ADHD-related variables from neuroimaging and behavioral assessments. This dataset integrates neuroimaging data (e.g., connectivity matrices) with clinical/behavioral metrics (e.g., ADHD symptoms, cognitive scores) to explore brain health disparities in women.
